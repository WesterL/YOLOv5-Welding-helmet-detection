# YOLOv5-Welding-helmet-detection
1. This repository provides an implementation step for welding helmet usage detection, mainly composed of dataset and improved YOLOv5.
2. The dataset is called Welding helmet and Human face Detection (WHD), of which welding helmet is collected via the web crawling and human face data is from the WIDER FACE dataset. Welding helmet dataset we collected can be available online.
3. The code and dataset are publicly available online. If our paper is published, we will release the improved code of YOLOv5 as soon as possible.
